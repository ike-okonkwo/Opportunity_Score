The Softmax algorithm explores by randomly selecting from all of the available arms with probabilities that are more-or-less proportional to the estimated value of each of the arms. If the other arms are noticeably worse than the best arm, they\u2019re chosen with very low probability. If the arms all have similar values, they\u2019re each chosen nearly equally often."
